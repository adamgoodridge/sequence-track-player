# Media Player Shuffler
This is a pet project that allowed me to learn more about the Spring framework. Current refactoring it to apply clean principles.

In this public repo, it has been modified to be a podcast player.

Frontend is in JS and thymeleaf, it is far from best practices. I want to change to React at some point, but my focus on the backend

A Spring Boot based podcast player with advanced directory navigation and playback features. This project serves as a learning platform for me to learn Spring framework and clean architecture principles.

## ‚ú® Features

### üéµ Feed Navigation and Playback
* Navigates through hierarchical directory structures
* Plays feeds (audio content) in sequential order as users navigate directories
* Supports both random and ordered playback modes

### üíæ File System Integration
* Interfaces with a NAS or local file system to access media content
* Maps directory structures to navigable feeds
* Handles path formatting for cross-platform compatibility

### üìÅ Content Organization
* Calendar-based content organization
* Directory-based feed organization
* Logo management for feeds
* Bookmark functionality for tracks

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Track Selection & Playback
* Sequential playback through directory navigation
* Random track selection with preferences (specific days/times)
* Bookmarked track retrieval
* Parent-child relationship tracking for navigation history

## üîß Tech Stack
* `Java 17` - Core programming language
* `Spring Boot 3` - Application framework
* `Gradle` - Build and dependency management
* `Thymeleaf` - Server-side template engine
* `JavaScript` - Frontend functionality
* `Docker` - Containerization


### Key Services
The NasConnectorServiceFileSystem is a core service that handles file system interactions with the following capabilities:
* Listing and navigating directories
* Retrieving files and feeds
* Managing track selection (sequential)
* Calendar view integration
* Logo management
* Error handling for file operations

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
- [ ] Implement clean architecture patterns
- [ ] Migrate frontend to React
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

The application requires several configuration properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
# File System Configuration
# File share directory on the current server
file.share.root=<<FILE_SHARE_ROOT>>
# Windows path
file.share.windows.root=<<FILE_SHARE_WINDOWS_ROOT>>
file.slash=<<FILE_SLASH>>

# Server Configuration
server.port=8443
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:your-keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=<<KEYSTORE_KEY>>

# MongoDB Configuration
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://<<DB_USERNAME>>:<<DB_PASSWORD>>@<<MONGODB_HOST>>:27017/?tls=true
spring.data.mongodb.database=radioDB
```

### Required Environment Variables
* `DB_USERNAME` - MongoDB username
* `DB_PASSWORD` - MongoDB password
* `KEYSTORE_KEY` - SSL keystore password
* `MONGODB_HOST` - MongoDB server hostname
* `FILE_SHARE_ROOT` - Root path for Linux/Mac file system (e.g., /mnt/media/podcasts/)
* `FILE_SLASH` - The current slash for the current server (e.g. `/` for Linux/Mac or `\\` for windows)
* `FILE_SHARE_WINDOWS_ROOT` - Root path for Windows file system (e.g., P:\\podcasts\\)
